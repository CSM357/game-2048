game-2048

game-2048 is a functional implementation of the classic 2048 game built using React and Vite. It features smooth animations, responsive design for both desktop and mobile, and provides an enjoyable gameplay experience. To run the game locally, clone the repository and navigate into the project folder. Then install the dependencies using npm and start the development server. Once the server is running, open your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173
) to play the game. For production, you can build the project using npm, which will create optimized files in the dist folder ready for deployment. This project is open-source and available under the MIT License. You can also add a demo link or GIF here if you deploy the game online.
